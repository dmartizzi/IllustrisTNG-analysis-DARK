# IllustrisTNG analysis tools from DARK

This is a set of basic tools to use the IllustrisTNG Public Data Release (Nelson et al. 2019) API to pull and analyze data from the IllustrisTNG simulations.

The tools were written by Davide Martizzi in a few hours and are only supposed to be used as a test of the API.
